# 🧠 Pokémon AI Agent

A smart conversational assistant built with **LangChain** and **ChatGPT-4o Mini**, capable of handling advanced Pokémon strategy queries and analysis. It integrates tools like **Smogon**, **DuckDuckGo**, and competitive team data to provide fast, detailed, and natural explanations.

This project is designed for both **casual** and **competitive** players who want quick, high-quality strategic insights.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔎 1. General Pokémon Info  
Ask about **any Pokémon**, and the assistant returns clean, markdown-formatted summaries including:

- Typing  
- Abilities  
- Lore  
- General stats and usage  

> **Example:**  
> `What is Garchomp’s typing and ability?`

---

### ⚔️ 2. Competitive Strategy Insights  
Get detailed **strategy breakdowns** for specific Pokémon. Optionally, filter by **generation** and **tier**.

The AI analyzes the tool output and rewrites it **in its own words**—not copying raw text or HTML. You get a natural summary with:

- 🛡️ **Role**  
- 🧠 **Moveset**  
- 🤝 **Teammates**  
- ⚠️ **Threats**  
- 💡 **Tips**

> **Examples:**  
> `Charizard build in Gen7 OU`  
> `How do people use Umbreon in Gen8 UU?`

---

### 🧩 3. Team Search by Pokémon  
Ask for **sample teams** that include specific Pokémon, filtered by **generation** and **tier**.

Each team includes:

- Full Pokémon roster  
- Moves, abilities, natures, EVs/IVs  
- Showdown export format (📋)  
- Clean markdown layout  

> **Examples:**  
> `Charizard team Gen7 OU`  
> `Teams with Gliscor in Gen6`
